# 📚 Book Recommendation System (User-Based Filtering)

This project is a simple AI-powered book recommendation system using **collaborative filtering**. It recommends books to users based on **similar users' ratings** using **cosine similarity**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Uses `pandas` to prepare user-book rating matrix
- Applies `cosine_similarity` from `scikit-learn` to calculate user similarity
- Recommends unseen books weighted by similarity scores
- Easily extendable for real-world datasets

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Collaborative Filtering (User-Based)
- Cosine Similarity (from `sklearn`)
- Pandas Pivot Table
- Dictionary-based weighted score calculation

---

## 🛠️ Skills Gained

- Data manipulation using `pandas`
- Recommender systems fundamentals
- Implementing similarity metrics
- Structuring reusable Python functions


## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Understanding how to normalize similarity scores
- Ensuring no already-rated books are recommended again
- Learning how to use pivot tables for matrix transformation
